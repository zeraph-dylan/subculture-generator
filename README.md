# subculture-generator
Generate unique and funny subculture names with Javascript on a website.

This project was created with GG Irkalla for the Up the Witchpunx website (http://www.upthewitchpunx.com). GG helped to create the idea and populate the arrays.

The code can be dropped into any website without changes to the CSS, but tweaking the CSS will give a better appearance.

While we use subcultural terms in good fun (and ourselves belong to some of the categories used) we are firmly anti-oppression and pro-justice. We don't condone any nasty or oppressive use of this generator.
